Student Sorting Algorithm
Overview
This project implements a student sorting algorithm in C++ that assigns students to classes based on their preferences. The algorithm aims to optimize the satisfaction of both students and classes by considering the preferences provided by the students.

How it Works
The algorithm takes into account the preferences of each student regarding the classes they want to join. It then assigns students to classes while trying to maximize the overall satisfaction. The satisfaction metric may be based on factors such as student preferences, class availability, or other relevant criteria.

Input Format
The input to the algorithm consists of:

Number of Students (x): Total number of students participating.
Number of Classes (n): Total number of classes available.
Student Preferences: Each student provides a ranked list of preferred classes.
